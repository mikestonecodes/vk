vkCmdDraw(): vkCmdSetColorBlendEquationEXT needs to be set for color attachmet index 0 (VkRenderingInfo::pColorAttachments[0].imageView)
The Vulkan spec states: If a shader object is bound to the VK_SHADER_STAGE_FRAGMENT_BIT stage or a graphics pipeline is bound was created with VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_COLOR_BLEND_ADVANCED_EXT and VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_COLOR_BLEND_EQUATION_EXT dynamic state enabled, and the current value of rasterizerDiscardEnable is VK_FALSE, then either vkCmdSetColorBlendAdvancedEXT or vkCmdSetColorBlendEquationEXT must have been called and not subsequently invalidated in the current command buffer prior to this drawing command for all active color attachments with the blendEnable current value of VK_TRUE (https://docs.vulkan.org/spec/latest/chapters/drawing.html#VUID-vkCmdDraw-None-10864)
Validation layer: (Warning - This VUID has now been reported 10 times, which is the duplicate_message_limit value, this will be the last time reporting it).
vkCmdDraw(): The combination of graphic shader objects bound is invalid, because shader stages VK_SHADER_STAGE_VERTEX_BIT (VkShaderEXT 0x360000000036) and VK_SHADER_STAGE_FRAGMENT_BIT (VkShaderEXT 0x370000000037) are bound with no other stages between them.
The VK_SHADER_STAGE_VERTEX_BIT shader was created with nextStage of VkShaderStageFlags(0) but needs to be VK_SHADER_STAGE_FRAGMENT_BIT.
The Vulkan spec states: For each shader object bound to a graphics stage, except for shader object bound to the last graphics stage in the logical pipeline, it must have been created with a nextStage including the corresponding bit to the shader object bound to the following graphics stage in the logical pipeline (https://docs.vulkan.org/spec/latest/chapters/drawing.html#VUID-vkCmdDraw-nextStage-10745)
Validation layer: (Warning - This VUID has now been reported 10 times, which is the duplicate_message_limit value, this will be the last time reporting it).
vkCmdDraw(): There is no graphics pipeline bound and vkCmdBindShadersEXT() was not called with stage VK_SHADER_STAGE_TESSELLATION_CONTROL_BIT. (If the tessellationShader is enabled, the stage needs to be provided, it can be bound with VK_NULL_HANDLE).
The Vulkan spec states: If there is no bound graphics pipeline, and the tessellationShader feature is enabled, vkCmdBindShadersEXT must have been called in the current command buffer with pStages with an element of VK_SHADER_STAGE_TESSELLATION_CONTROL_BIT (https://docs.vulkan.org/spec/latest/chapters/drawing.html#VUID-vkCmdDraw-None-08685)
Validation layer: (Warning - This VUID has now been reported 10 times, which is the duplicate_message_limit value, this will be the last time reporting it).
vkCmdDraw(): There is no graphics pipeline bound and vkCmdBindShadersEXT() was not called with stage VK_SHADER_STAGE_TESSELLATION_EVALUATION_BIT. (If the tessellationShader is enabled, the stage needs to be provided, it can be bound with VK_NULL_HANDLE).
The Vulkan spec states: If there is no bound graphics pipeline, and the tessellationShader feature is enabled, vkCmdBindShadersEXT must have been called in the current command buffer with pStages with an element of VK_SHADER_STAGE_TESSELLATION_EVALUATION_BIT (https://docs.vulkan.org/spec/latest/chapters/drawing.html#VUID-vkCmdDraw-None-08686)
Validation layer: (Warning - This VUID has now been reported 10 times, which is the duplicate_message_limit value, this will be the last time reporting it).
vkCmdDraw(): There is no graphics pipeline bound and vkCmdBindShadersEXT() was not called with stage VK_SHADER_STAGE_GEOMETRY_BIT. (If the geometryShader is enabled, the stage needs to be provided, it can be bound with VK_NULL_HANDLE).
The Vulkan spec states: If there is no bound graphics pipeline, and the geometryShader feature is enabled, vkCmdBindShadersEXT must have been called in the current command buffer with pStages with an element of VK_SHADER_STAGE_GEOMETRY_BIT (https://docs.vulkan.org/spec/latest/chapters/drawing.html#VUID-vkCmdDraw-None-08687)
Validation layer: (Warning - This VUID has now been reported 10 times, which is the duplicate_message_limit value, this will be the last time reporting it).
vkCmdDraw(): The bound VK_SHADER_STAGE_VERTEX_BIT shader was created with a pushConstantRangeCount of 0 which doesn't match the bound VK_SHADER_STAGE_FRAGMENT_BIT shader create with a pushConstantRangeCount of 1.
The Vulkan spec states: All bound graphics shader objects must have been created with identical or identically defined push constant ranges (https://docs.vulkan.org/spec/latest/chapters/drawing.html#VUID-vkCmdDraw-None-08878)
