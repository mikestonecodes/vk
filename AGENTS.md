- When odin files get saved , it auomaticly recomples and shows the code
- read the logs what happend by looking in  odin-launcher.reload.log
- Dont ever *complete* task without making sure no validation errors from odin-launcher.reload.log, just check at end
the changes you did worked. you can ignore this for tools directory
- unless you are working on something, try to undo changes that didn't work and keep codebase clean
- make small code changes if you can

- NO NEED TO RUN vk , odin run .  , odin build. , dxc or compile shaders  . dont ever do that. i am running another process that auto
compiles everything . Just read odin-launcher.reload.log . assume its alwasy working. it clears the log every time it
rebuilds automaticly from file change
